JustAnotherTechMod
==================

This is a reboot of AltEnergy mod I was working on in the past. The third reboot to be extact.

What this mod adds to minecraft is:

Ore processing multiblocks tiers:

Tier 1 Would look like heavy industral equpment. Lots of pipes wires and structual supports expossed.

Tier 2 More streemlined but still have a industral look to it.

Tier 3 Very high tech look. Lots of glowy strips and science fictiony.

A control network for the MB doors/force fields.

*WIP*
