# JustAnotherTechMod(JATM)
==================

This is a reboot of AltEnergy mod I was working on in the past. The third reboot to be extact.

What this mod adds to minecraft is:
* Advanced Ore Processing(Also expensive to make)
* xTimes ore processing
* Lots of Multiblock machines
* Multiblock Doors(Unsure if it's workable)
* A Central Control System

# Ore processing multiblocks tiers:

### **Tier 1**
  Would look like heavy industral equpment. Lots of pipes wires and structual supports expossed.

### **Tier 2**
  More streemlined but still have a industral look to it.

### **Tier 3**
  Very high tech look. Lots of glowy strips and science fictiony.
