The third reboot to be extact.\r\n\r\nWhat this mod adds to minecraft is:\r\n* Advanced Ore Processing(Also expensive to make)\r\n* xTimes ore processing\r\n* Lots of Multiblock machines\r\n* Multiblock Doors(Unsure if it's workable)\r\n* A Central Control System\r\n\r\n# Ore processing multiblocks tiers:\r\n\r\n### **Tier 1**\r\n    Would look like heavy industral equpment. Lots of pipes wires and structual supports expossed.\r\n\r\n### **Tier 2**\r\n    More streemlined but still have a industral look to it.\r\n\r\n### **Tier 3**\r\n    Very high tech look. Lots of glowy strips and science fictiony.\r\n\r\n-WIP-\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
